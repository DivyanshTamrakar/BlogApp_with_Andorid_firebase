    <string name="lorem">Cyclone Ada was a small but intense tropical cyclone that
    severely impacted the Whitsunday Region of Queensland, Australia, in January 1970.
    It formed over the far eastern Coral Sea early in the month, remaining weak and disorganised for nearly two weeks before
    being named. The extremely compact cyclone, with a reported gale radius of 55 km (35 mi), intensified into a Category 3 severe
    tropical cyclone just before striking the Whitsunday Islands on 17 January. Resorts on Daydream, South Molle, Hayman and Longislands
    were obliterated. Based on the severity of the damage, wind gusts were later estimated at 220 km/h (140 mph). Near the point of Adas landfall
    almost all the homes in Cannonvale, Airlie Beach and Shute Harbour were destroyed. Rainfall totals as high as 1.25 m (49 in) caused massive river
    flooding in coastal waterways between Bowen and Mackay. Ada killed 14 people, including 11 at sea, and caused A$12 million in damage
